>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Work-in-progress** - Planetary is currently in the process of updating this read me and creating our documentation for Orbit. We recommend you host for free with Planetary Cloud, however you can still self-host by following our <a href="https://docs.planetaryapp.us">Documentation</a>. Expect bugs in this beta. We've tried our best to iron out everything we could find in Tovy, but we expect there to be issues. Let us know by creating an issue, or if you're adventurous... patch it yourself and send in a PR.

>[!TIP]
> The best and easiest way to get started with Orbit is our cloud hosting solution, Planetary Cloud. It's easy, secure, and supafast. See https://planetaryapp.us to get started. The best part? It's **FREE**!

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Orbit is a modern, improved, and maintained fork of the open source staff management platform, Tovy. It allows Roblox groups to manage their group members in a more intuitive and powerful way, while still being simple to use. Planetary aims to continue the original Tovy mission and maintain, improve, and introduce new features to Orbit. So far, we've fixed critical bugs that essentially bricked Tovy, improved the UI, and introduced image support to the wall. We also created our own custom runtime and cloud hosting service to bring Orbit to the masses for free, in just a few clicks.
